# Linux Virtual Joystick
This is a simple program that creates a virtual joystick on your computer. I use it to develop software that needs a joystick, without actually having a joystick on-hand. it was inspired by the basic functionality of [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/). 

## Compilation
To compile from source you will need [cargo and rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).To install from source clone this repository and `cargo build`.
## Usage
To start the program just `cargo run`.
